# The Ring
## Ring signature implementation in Java

This program performs a 2 user ring signature and validation.

Note that all values are handled in radix-16 (base-16) in this program, however, all input files must be in radix-10.

A sample of the message and public key files is provided.

*Note: Due to the way new lines are handled on different operating systems, input files may not be transferrable between Windows, macOS, and UNIX systems. *
